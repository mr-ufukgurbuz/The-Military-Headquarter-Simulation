# The-Military-Headquarter-Simulation

I made a military headquarters simulation using AnyLogic Simulation program with my team friend. This simulation contains many components (cars, soldiers, military buildings and areas). Firstly, we design a military headquarters. The coming cars will enter queue. There are 5 soldiers in entry for security. They check identities of coming people. Then the soldiers search their cars.
